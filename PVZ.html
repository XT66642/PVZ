                    <p>Plants vs. Zombies was first named as 'Lawn Of the Dead', referring to the zombie movie :'Dawn of the dead'. For legal reasons, it was finally renamed as Plants vs. Zombies. </p>
                    <p>Plants vs. Zombies is a very strategic little game. The terrible zombies are about to invade, each zombie has different characteristics, such as iron bucket zombies have a strong ability to fight, miners zombies can dig tunnels around the plants planted on the surface of the soil. The way the player defends against zombies is by planting plants. Each of the 49 plants has a different function, such as cherry bombs that can die with all the zombies in a certain range of surroundings, while cannibalism can eat the zombie closest to itself. Players can plant plants for the weaknesses of different zombies, which is the trick to victory. The game is divided into five modes according to the gameplay: adventure mode, mini mode, puzzle mode, survival mode, and Zen garden. And obstacles such as night, roof, fog and swimming pools add to the challenge. The game is almost endless. </p>
